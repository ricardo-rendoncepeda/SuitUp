# The Front

Your challenge for this one will be delivered with screenshots, and your task will be to write the code to produce them. All code must be written in **FrontView.swift** and verified in **FrontView.xib**, with a single `FrontView` and no additional UI components. It's recommended that you work with the split-pane Assistant Editor window for this challenge, with **FrontView.swift** in one pane and **FrontView.xib** in the other. After all, your task is to write the code that will programmatically create a customizable view for use with Interface Builder.

The end goal of this challenge is to allow a designer to be able to select a primary color, secondary color, rank, and suit to test the look of all 52 cards in a deck, without having to build and run the app. Once completed, you should have a wonderful front view for your deck of cards!

## Part 1: IBInspectables
Before you do anything else, make sure you have these four `@IBInspectable`s displaying in *Interface Builder* with the correct types.

## Part 2: Prepare for IB
Next up, all your code besides the `@IBInspectable` declarations should be contained inside `prepareForInterfaceBuilder`.

If you get this part rendering, then congratulations! This was a tough one, but not unlike working with rough mockups from a design team. You now have plenty of experience with Dynamic Custom Controls in Xcode 6.

Just like before, if you have some extra time and are feeling brave, try setting some auto layout constraints and verify them using the assistant editor preview :]
